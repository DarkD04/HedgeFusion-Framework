# About
Hedgefusion is merge project between FusionSonic and Hedgespin frameowrk created by DarkD04 and chopp!
Included in this repository is every version/ideration of the framework between begining and release.

(A few versions have been overwritten during collaberation so make sure to check the commits if you have trouble finding it)


# Note before downloading
The folder that is labled "HEDGEFUSIONREV0 Source + Executable" are the most current versions of the framework
EVERYTHING ELSE is older, and I dont 100% do not recomend using them.

These all require Clickteam Fusion 2.5 and its "Plus" DLC.
