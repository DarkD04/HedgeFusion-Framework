# About
Hedgefusion is merge project between FusionSonic and Hedgespin frameowrk created by DarkD04 and chopp!
Included in this repository is every version/ideration of the framework between begining and release.

(A few versions have been overwritten during collaberation so make sure to check the commits if you have trouble finding it)

CREDIT THE HEDGEFUSION TEAM IF YOU USE ANY ORIGINAL ASSETS FROM THE SOURCE CODE GIVEN!!!
((bonus note: older builds may inclue assets that do not belong to us and should most definatly not be used before prior knowledge))


# Note before downloading
The folder that is labled "HEDGEFUSIONREV0 Source + Executable" are the most current versions of the framework
EVERYTHING ELSE is older, and I 100% do not recomend using them.

These all require Clickteam Fusion 2.5 and its "Plus" DLC.
